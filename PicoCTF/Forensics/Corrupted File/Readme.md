## Corrupted File

<br>

Description

This file seems broken... or is it? Maybe a couple of bytes could make all the difference. Can you figure out how to bring it back to life?

Hint
```text
    1. Try checking the file’s header.
    2. JPEG
    3. Tools like xxd or hexdump can help you inspect and edit file bytes.
```
